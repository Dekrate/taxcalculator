## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive rationale for the structural and logical modifications applied to the Tax Calculator application. The original implementation, while functional for its immediate purpose, exhibited numerous code quality issues and violations of established software engineering principles. The refactoring effort was undertaken to transition the codebase into a robust, maintainable, and scalable object-oriented design that adheres to industry standards.

The primary goals of this refactoring were:

* **Improve Maintainability:** Facilitate code modification and extension with new features such as additional contract types or changing tax regulations.
* **Enhance Readability:** Structure the code to ensure clarity of intent and reduce cognitive load for future developers.
* **Increase Robustness:** Minimize potential for defects by enforcing data integrity and logical consistency.
* **Adhere to Professional Standards:** Align the codebase with established Java best practices and conventions, as identified by static analysis tools including Checkstyle and SonarLint.
* **Eliminate Code Smells:** Address all 103 Checkstyle violations and various code quality issues.

## 2. Design Patterns and Architectural Improvements

### 2.1. Strategy Pattern Implementation

The most significant architectural change was the implementation of the Strategy design pattern to handle different contract types.

**Problem Identified:**
The original code contained extensive conditional logic with multiple if-else statements to handle different contract types. This approach violated the Open-Closed Principle and made the code difficult to extend.

**Solution Applied:**
* Created `TaxCalculationStrategy` interface defining the contract for tax calculation algorithms.
* Implemented two concrete strategies:
    * `EmploymentContractStrategy` for employment contracts (Umowa o pracÄ™)
    * `CivilContractStrategy` for civil contracts (Umowa cywilnoprawna)
* The `TaxCalculator` class maintains a map of strategies indexed by `ContractType`, enabling dynamic strategy selection at runtime.

**Benefits:**
* **Extensibility:** Adding new contract types requires only creating a new strategy class and registering it in the map. No modifications to existing code are necessary.
* **Testability:** Each strategy can be unit tested independently.
* **Separation of Concerns:** Each strategy encapsulates its specific calculation logic.
* **Open-Closed Principle:** The system is open for extension but closed for modification.

### 2.2. Separation of Concerns Through Class Decomposition

The monolithic structure was decomposed into multiple specialized classes, each with a single, well-defined responsibility:

**TaxCalculator:**
* Serves as the main orchestrator
* Manages the strategy pattern implementation
* Coordinates input reading, calculation, and output formatting
* Contains no business logic itself, delegating to appropriate components

**TaxInputReader:**
* Responsible exclusively for user input operations
* Encapsulates `BufferedReader` and input validation logic
* Implements proper error handling for invalid inputs
* Follows the Single Responsibility Principle

**TaxResultFormatter:**
* Handles all output formatting and display logic
* Provides consistent formatting using `DecimalFormat`
* Separates presentation concerns from business logic
* Utilizes Java's `Logger` for output instead of direct `System.out.println`

**SocialContributions:**
* Immutable value object representing social security contributions
* Encapsulates calculation logic for all types of social contributions
* Provides utility methods for total calculations
* Implemented as a `final` class to prevent inheritance

**HealthInsurance:**
* Immutable value object for health insurance calculations
* Maintains both full rate and deductible rate
* Implements static factory method pattern for object creation
* Ensures data consistency through immutability

**TaxResult:**
* Implemented as a Java record (immutable data carrier)
* Contains all calculated values from the tax computation
* Provides type-safe access to calculation results
* Eliminates the need for multiple return values or output parameters

---

### 2.3. Type Safety Through Enumeration

**ContractType Enum:**
The character-based contract type representation was replaced with a proper enumeration.

**Original Implementation Issues:**
* Used character literals ('E', 'C') which are not type-safe
* No compile-time validation of valid contract types
* Poor readability and lack of semantic meaning

**Refactored Implementation:**
* Defined `ContractType` enum with values `EMPLOYMENT` and `CIVIL`
* Each enum value contains:
    * Character code for backward compatibility with input parsing
    * Display name for user-friendly output
* Static factory method `fromCode()` for safe conversion from character input
* Utilizes a static map for efficient code-to-enum lookup

**Advantages:**
* Compiler-enforced type safety
* Self-documenting code
* IDE autocomplete support
* Eliminates entire class of runtime errors

---

## 3. Code Quality Improvements

### 3.1. Checkstyle Compliance (103 violations resolved)

**Line Length Violations (Multiple files):**
* All lines exceeding 80 characters were reformatted
* Long method chains were broken into multiple lines with appropriate indentation
* String literals and method calls were split for improved readability

**Final Parameters:**
* All method parameters marked as `final` to prevent accidental reassignment
* Enhances code clarity by making immutability explicit
* Aligns with functional programming principles

**JavaDoc Completeness:**
* Added comprehensive JavaDoc for all public classes and methods
* All fields, including private fields, now have descriptive documentation
* JavaDoc includes parameter descriptions, return value documentation, and exception specifications
* First sentences properly terminated with periods

**Design for Extension:**
* Strategy classes include JavaDoc explaining safe extension practices
* Clear documentation of class invariants and contracts

**Hidden Field Issues:**
* Constructor parameters renamed to avoid shadowing instance fields
* For example, `fullRate` parameter renamed to `fullRateValue`
* Eliminates potential confusion between parameters and fields

**Tab Character Elimination:**
* All tab characters replaced with spaces
* Ensures consistent formatting across different editors and environments

**Newline at End of File:**
* All files now properly terminate with a newline character
* Complies with POSIX standards

---

### 3.2. Magic Numbers Elimination

**Constants Extraction:**
All numeric literals were extracted to named constants in dedicated classes:

**TaxRates Class:**
* `SOCIAL_SECURITY_RATE` (9.76%)
* `HEALTH_SOCIAL_SECURITY_RATE` (1.5%)
* `SICKNESS_SOCIAL_SECURITY_RATE` (2.45%)
* `HEALTH_INSURANCE_FULL_RATE` (9.0%)
* `HEALTH_INSURANCE_DEDUCTIBLE_RATE` (7.75%)
* `ADVANCE_TAX_RATE` (18.0%)
* `EMPLOYMENT_TAX_DEDUCTIBLE_EXPENSES` (111.25 PLN)
* `TAX_FREE_INCOME` (46.33 PLN)
* `CIVIL_CONTRACT_DEDUCTIBLE_RATE` (20.0%)
* `PERCENTAGE_DIVISOR` (100.0)

**TaxConstants Class:**
* `CURRENCY_SCALE` (2 decimal places)
* `CURRENCY_ROUNDING_MODE` (HALF_UP)
* `FLOOR_ROUNDING_MODE` (DOWN)
* `INTEGER_SCALE` (0 decimal places)

**Benefits:**
* Single source of truth for all rate values
* Easy to update when tax laws change
* Improved code documentation through descriptive names
* Facilitates testing with different rate scenarios

---

### 3.3. BigDecimal Implementation

**Problem:**
The original code used `double` for monetary calculations, which can lead to precision errors in financial computations.

**Solution:**
* All monetary values now use `BigDecimal` for exact decimal arithmetic
* Appropriate rounding modes specified for all division operations
* Scale management ensures consistent decimal places
* All calculations maintain precision required for currency

**Implementation Details:**
* Currency values use 2-decimal scale with HALF_UP rounding
* Intermediate calculations preserve full precision
* Floor rounding (DOWN mode) used for taxable income calculations
* Final tax values rounded to whole numbers (0-decimal scale)

---

### 3.4. Naming Conventions and Readability

**Variable Naming:**
All variables now follow standard Java naming conventions:
* camelCase for variables and methods
* UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constants
* PascalCase for classes and enums
* Descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose

**Method Naming:**
* Methods named with verbs indicating their action
* `calculate()`, `displayResult()`, `readIncome()`, `fromCode()`
* Boolean methods prefixed appropriately (where applicable)

**Class Naming:**
* Nouns representing clear abstractions
* Avoids abbreviations in favor of clarity
* Examples: `TaxCalculationStrategy`, `SocialContributions`, `HealthInsurance`

---

## 4. Error Handling and Validation

### 4.1. Input Validation

**TaxInputReader Implementation:**
* Validates income is not null, empty, or negative
* Validates contract type input is not null or empty
